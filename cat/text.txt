Prayer To Persephone

	Be to her, Persephone,
	All the things I might not be;
	Take her head upon your knee.
	She that was so proud and wild,
	Flippant, arrogant and free,

	She that had no need of me,
	Is a little lonely child
	Lost in Hell,—Persephone,
	Take her head upon your knee;
	Say to her, “My dear, my dear,
	It is not so dreadful here.”
